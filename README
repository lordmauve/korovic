Doctor Korovic's Flying Atomic Squid
====================================

Working from his secret volcano lair in the Pacific Ocean, Doctor Korovic has
created an atomic super-squid with which to take over the world!

Alas, Susie, the squid, is allergic to sea water.

Doctor Korovic has conceived a most fiendish plan - Susie must take to the
skies!

Running
-------

To run the game, run ``run_game.py``, or if you have installed it (see below),
then just run ``korovic``.

You can start the game at any level by using the ``--level`` switch, eg. ::

    $ korovic --level 2

Installing
----------

Doctor Korovic's Flying Atomic Squid is packaged with distribute. You will need
either distribute or setuptools to be able to install this (distribute is
preferred).

It can be installed with setup.py::

    $ python setup.py install

Or from PyPI:

    $ pip install korovic

Both of these approaches work with virtualenvs, and will install dependencies.
Note that this depends on the dependencies being available to pip/easy_install.
In particular pygame seems not to be currently pip installable on Linux as it
selects a Mac build by default. The other packages are automatically
installable.

Dependencies needed
-------------------

If you choose not to use pip, you will need to install the following
dependencies:

* pyglet>=1.1.4
* pymunk==2.1.0
* pygame>=1.9.1release
* lepton==1.0b2

Editing
-------

In the editor, click and drag on the menu to scroll it.

You can also click on many components to adjust their angles, and drag them
between slots. Most components are limited in the slots they can be put into.

When you are ready to fly, click "Fly".

Controls
--------

Control is on the number keys. Icons in the bottom right will display the key
for each component you have attached to Susie.

To return to the editor, press Escape.
